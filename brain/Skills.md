# Skills

Custom slash commands, subagents, and reusable workflows. Defined in `.claude/commands/` and `.claude/agents/`.

## Slash Commands

### Daily Workflow

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/om-standup` | Morning kickoff — load context, review yesterday, surface tasks, identify priorities |
| `/om-dump` | Freeform capture — dump anything, gets routed to the right notes automatically |
| `/om-wrap-up` | Full session review — verify notes, indexes, links, suggest improvements. Auto-triggered on "wrap up". |

### Editing & Synthesis

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/om-humanize` | Voice-calibrated editing — makes Claude-drafted text sound like you wrote it |
| `/om-weekly` | Weekly synthesis — cross-session patterns, North Star alignment, uncaptured wins |

### Meeting Prep & Capture

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/om-prep-1on1` | Prep for an upcoming 1:1 — load person context, open items, wins to share, suggested agenda |
| `/om-capture-1on1` | Capture 1:1 meeting transcript into structured vault note with quotes, action items, DM context |
| `/om-incident-capture` | Capture incident from Slack channels/DMs into structured vault notes — timeline, people, analysis, brag entry |
| `/om-slack-scan` | Deep scan Slack channels/DMs for evidence — extracts timestamped touchpoints, organizes by context |
| `/om-meeting` | Prep for any meeting by topic — subject-forward briefing with open items, blockers, and brainstormed considerations |
| `/om-intake` | Process meeting notes inbox — classify raw exports in `work/meetings/` and route to the right vault notes |

### Performance & Review

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/om-peer-scan` | Deep scan a peer's GitHub PRs for review prep — produces structured analysis saved to `perf/evidence/` |
| `/om-review-brief` | Generate review brief (manager or peer version) from vault data |
| `/om-self-review` | Write self-assessment for review tool — projects, competencies, principles |
| `/om-review-peer` | Write peer review — projects, principles, performance summary |

### Vault Maintenance

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/om-vault-audit` | Deep structural audit — indexes, frontmatter, links, Bases, folder placement, stale context |
| `/om-vault-upgrade` | Import content from an existing vault — detects version, classifies notes, transforms frontmatter, rebuilds indexes |
| `/om-project-archive` | Move completed project from `work/active/` to `work/archive/YYYY/`, update all indexes |

## Subagents

| Agent | Purpose | Invoked by |
|-------|---------|------------|
| `brag-spotter` | Proactively finds uncaptured wins and competency gaps | `/om-wrap-up`, `/om-weekly` |
| `context-loader` | Loads all vault context about a person, project, incident, or concept | Direct — "load context on X" |
| `cross-linker` | Finds missing wikilinks, orphans, broken backlinks across the vault | `/om-vault-audit` |
| `people-profiler` | Bulk create/update person notes from Slack profiles | `/om-incident-capture` |
| `review-prep` | Aggregates all performance evidence for a given review period | `/om-review-brief` |
| `slack-archaeologist` | Full Slack reconstruction — reads every message, thread, profile, produces unified timeline | `/om-incident-capture` |
| `vault-librarian` | Deep vault maintenance — orphan detection, broken links, frontmatter validation, stale notes | `/om-vault-audit` |
| `review-fact-checker` | Verify every claim in a review draft against vault sources | `/om-self-review`, `/om-review-peer` |
| `vault-migrator` | Classify, transform, and migrate content from a source vault | `/om-vault-upgrade` |

## Hooks

| Hook | When | What |
|------|------|------|
| SessionStart | On startup/resume | QMD re-index, inject North Star, active work, recent changes, tasks, file listing |
| UserPromptSubmit | Every message | Classify content (decision, incident, 1:1, win, architecture, person, project update) and inject routing hints |
| PostToolUse | After writing `.md` | Validates frontmatter, checks for wikilinks |
| PreCompact | Before context compaction | Back up session transcript to `thinking/session-logs/` |
| Stop | End of session | Checklist: archive, update indexes, check orphans |

## Semantic Search (QMD)

If QMD is installed (`npm install -g @tobilu/qmd`), the vault has semantic search:

- `qmd --index obsidian-mind query "..."` — hybrid BM25 + vector + LLM reranking
- `qmd --index obsidian-mind search "..."` — fast BM25 keyword search
- `qmd --index obsidian-mind vsearch "..."` — semantic vector search
- `qmd --index obsidian-mind update && qmd --index obsidian-mind embed` — refresh index

SessionStart hook runs `qmd update` automatically. First-time setup: `node --experimental-strip-types scripts/qmd-bootstrap.ts`.
